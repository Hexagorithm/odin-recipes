            Description
        </h2>

        <p>
            Home-made tortilla chips from pre-made tortillas with the taste of chili, baked in the oven. Spicy chips with a hint of sweetness will with certainty appeal to fans of heat. Their preparation is very simple and fast - you only need pre-made tortillas, olive oil and seasoning, and the snack will be ready in a dozen minutes. Instead of using normal olive oil and dried chilli a store-bought chilli-flavoured olive is also viable.
            <br>
            They fit in well as a snack on parties, during the film or for a evening with some friends.

            Steps

                    <p>
                        To a bowl, pour in the olive oil and add the dried chilli. We set that aside for 20-30 minutes, in order to let the olive oil soak up the heat of the chilli (this step can be ignored if you have a chilli-floavoured olive oil).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Cut each tortilla into 4 stripes, and then each stripe into small triangles.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Spread the oil on both sides of each tortilla triangle using a pastry brush.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Lay the triangles aside each other on a baking sheet with baking paper on it.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Put the baking sheet in to the oven, set to 170 Celsius.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Bake for about 10-12 minutes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
