        <p>
            Home-made tortilla chips from pre-made tortillas with the taste of chili, baked in the oven. Spicy chips with a hint of sweetness will with certainty appeal to fans of heat. Their preparation is very simple and fast - you only need pre-made tortillas, olive oil and seasoning, and the snack will be ready in a dozen minutes. Instead of using normal olive oil and dried chilli a store-bought chilli-flavoured olive is also viable.
            <br>
            They fit in well as a snack on parties, during the film or for a evening with some friends.
