                    Cut the tortilla flatbread into 16 semi-equal triangles.
                </p>
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Coat the tortilla triangles made before from both sides with the mush. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Lay them beside each other on a baking sheet with baking paper.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Put the baking sheet in the cooker set to 160 degrees Celcius.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Cook the chips for about 13 minutes.
