Recipes website

In this project I will attempt to build a simple
recipe website. This website will (as of writing
this) not contain CSS or JS, since i do not know
anything about those languages. This will be only
HTML.

The goal of this project is to practice and show-
case my aquired knowledge of web development us-
ing the Hypertext Markup Language thanks to The
 Odin Project.

My current knowledge of HTMl:
 - html boilerplate
 - headings
 - paragraph
 - text formatting (strong, emphasis)
 - anchor inclusion
 - image inclusion
